          Cursed Techniques are abilities fueled by cursed energy. Different types include innate techniques,
          barrier techniques, shikigami, new shadow style, and more.

        <h2>Technique Activation</h2>
        <p>
          A cursed technique is activated by pouring cursed energy into it using one of two processes:
          <u>Lapse</u> or <u>Reversal</u>. If cursed energy is comparable to electricity, cursed techniques
          are the appliances that use that power to function.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Lapse vs Reversal -->
      <section class="cursed-techniques">
        <div class="technique">
          <h3><ruby>順転<rt>Junten</rt></ruby></h3>
          <p>
            Lapse refers to the default state of activation for a cursed technique. The caster circulates their
            cursed energy forward to channel it into their ability.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
          <h3><ruby>反転<rt>Hanten</rt></ruby></h3>
          <p>
            Reversal generates positive energy by multiplying negative energy with negative energy. Negative
            energy can’t heal, but positive energy can recover physical injuries.

          <h3><ruby>十種影法術<rt>Tokusa no Kage Bojutsu</rt></ruby></h3>
          <img src="./assets/tokusa.jpeg" alt="Ten Shadows Technique" class="float-left" />
          <p>
            <u>The Ten Shadows Technique</u> is an inherited Zen’in Clan ability that allows its wielder to summon
            and command up to ten shikigami using shadows as a medium. Each shikigami must first be exorcised before
            it can be tamed, forcing the user into life-or-death battles to claim them. Once bound, these familiars
            can emerge from darkness at will, fighting alongside their master or being combined in creative ways.
            If a shikigami is destroyed, its strength and abilities are absorbed into the remaining ones, allowing
            the technique to evolve with every loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes the Ten Shadows so feared is not just its versatility but its untapped potential. Among its
            familiars lies Mahoraga, a divine beast said to adapt to any phenomenon or attack—a power so overwhelming
            that no sorcerer has ever fully controlled it. Though outcast by his clan, Megumi Fushiguro wields the
            technique with unorthodox creativity, treating his shikigami as partners. His ingenuity hints that Ten
            Shadows could one day rival the legendary techniques of the Gojo Clan.

        <!-- Limitless -->
        <section class="tech-block">
          <h3><ruby>無下限<rt>Mukagen</rt></ruby></h3>
          <img src="./assets/mukagen.jpeg" alt="The Limitless Technique" class="float-right" />
          <p>
            <u>The Limitless Technique</u> is the Gojo Clan’s inherited ability that manipulates space using the
            concept of infinity. Attacks slow to a halt before reaching the user as distances are endlessly divided.
            This passive defense makes the sorcerer nearly untouchable, but Limitless also enables powerful
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            **Blue** compresses space to attract, **Red** repels with overwhelming force, and **Hollow Purple**
            annihilates anything in its path by collapsing existence. At peak mastery, **Unlimited Void** overwhelms
            targets with infinite information. With the Six Eyes reducing energy cost, Gojo Satoru alone has wielded
            Limitless to its full potential.

          <img src="./assets/jurei.jpeg" alt="Cursed Spirit Manipulation" class="float-left" />
          <p>
            <u>The Cursed Spirit Manipulation Technique</u> allows the user to absorb and command cursed spirits.
            After exorcising a spirit, the technique consumes its essence and binds it to the user’s will. Bound
            spirits retain their abilities and can be summoned as an arsenal tailored to each battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suguru Geto used this technique to amass thousands of curses, from fodder to special grades. By combining
            spirits and layering abilities, he exploited enemy weaknesses and overwhelmed even elite sorcerers—making
            him a strategic counterpart to Gojo’s overwhelming force.
