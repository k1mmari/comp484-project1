      <h2>The Plot: Don't Eat Fingers</h2>
      <p>Yuji Itadori is an expert at track and field. But he has zero interest running around in circles,
        he's happy as a clam in the Occult Research Club. Although he's only in the club for kicks, things get serious when
        a real spirit shows up at school!</p>

      <p>When his grandfather is on his deathbed, Yuji makes a promise to him; that he will do kind deeds so that he dies
        surrounded by loved ones, unlike his grandfather.</p>

        However, Yuji's life takes a sudden turn as he meets Megumi Fushiguro; a jujutsu sorcerer who tries to retrieve a
        cursed object. When Yuji's friends open the cursed object that they found, things go south as the cursed spirits that it
        spawned start roaming in school. As Fushiguro and Yuji are almost defeated by one of the spirits, Yuji then swallows the
        cursed object and gains its power. As a result, Yuji becomes cursed by the object and gets dragged into Fushiguro's
        thrilling world of jujutsu sorcerers and cursed spirits.</p>

      <h2>The Plot: Everybody Was Waiting for Gojo, And He Turned Into A Cube</h2>
      <p>TThe Shibuya Incident begins on October 31st, when powerful curses and rogue sorcerers trap thousands of civilians
        inside Shibuya Station using a massive barrier. Their main objective is to seal Satoru Gojo, the strongest jujutsu sorcerer,
        whose overwhelming power has long kept curses in check. Gojo fights through hordes of enemies with ease, but is ultimately
        sealed inside the Prison Realm due to a carefully orchestrated plan by Kenjaku (disguised as Suguru Geto). His removal
        shatters the balance of power and plunges the jujutsu world into chaos. </p>

      <p>

        With Gojo gone, the students and sorcerers of Jujutsu High—Yuji, Megumi, Nobara, and their allies—are forced to face off
        against some of the deadliest curse users and special grade curses. Intense battles erupt across Shibuya:
        Yuji faces Choso and Mahito, Megumi is pushed to the brink of death summoning his most dangerous shikigami,
        and Nobara’s encounter with Mahito has devastating consequences. The arc emphasizes sacrifice, desperation, and the brutality
        of cursed techniques as the battlefield grows bloodier.</p>

      <p>By the end of the incident, the sorcerers suffer heavy casualties, Shibuya itself is left in ruins, and the public
        becomes aware of the overwhelming threat curses pose. Kenjaku reveals his true identity and future plans, setting up the next
        phase of the conflict. The Shibuya Incident Arc is considered a turning point in Jujutsu Kaisen, stripping away the sense of
        safety provided by Gojo and forcing the younger generation of sorcerers into the harshest battles of their lives.</p>
